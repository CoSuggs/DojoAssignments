        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Cody, it's a pleasure to meet you! <br>
                I am on the road to becoming a developer, and this marks day one of my journey so far. <br>
                I am very interested in learning all I can throughout the Coding Dojo, and taking that with me for the rest of my carreer. <br>
            </p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                <h3><strong>Some of my current hobbies include:</strong></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dungeons and Dragons, mostly as the dungeon master!</li>
                    <li>World building, for other creators, especially for authors and fellow dungeon masters.</li>
                    <li>Playing video games, mostly games like Craftopia, 7 Days to Die and the like.</li>
                    <li>Watching anime, I am a fan of Issekai animes.</li>
                </ul>

        <h2>What kind of carrers am I hoping to get into?</h2>
            <p>Well, I hope to get into the coding side of the tech indistry. <br>
            I enjoy the idea of cyber security work, but feel I will benifit in a capacity to create. <br>
            Mostly I guess that means I want to help build websites, and possibly help create a new tool for dungeon masters. <br> 
            A tool for getting groups of players together, and linking up with other dms. <br>
            A social networking app for DMs and players would be an excellent tool currently to helping DMs to finding the right players for their games. <br>
            This of course is only one project, of many I would enjoy working on, and creating.
